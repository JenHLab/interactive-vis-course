# Interactive Data Vis Course Repo

Repo for U of Miami School of Communication course on interactive data visualization for the web by Lynn Cherny (fall 2015 and spring 2016).  The repo is best viewed on github.io: http://arnicas.github.io/interactive-vis-course/. Lynn is @arnicas on twitter.

    Office Hours: Wolfson 1020A, M & Th 1-3 or by appt.
    Emails for homework: arnicas@gmail.com

## What the Course Covers

### 1. Interactive Data Vis: Design Principles, Techniques, Best-Practices...

Originally intended as having a journalistic focus, the course contents will expand a little more in spring 2016 to address broader topics in visualization. (Those additions are in progress.)

* [Week1](Week1): Intro to Tools and the Course, Setup, CSVs
* [Week2](Week2): Loading CSV Data, Highcharts
* [Week3](Week3): Data Loading, Tables in D3
* [Week4](Week4): More tables, Scales, SVG
* [Week5](Week5): Bar Charts, Axes, Text Labels, Scatterplots
* [Week6](Week6): Linecharts, Events, Simple Tooltips
* [Week7](Week7): Improved Line Charts, Transitions
* [Week8](Week8): Updates to Data, More Transitions
* [Week9](Week9): Stacking Chart Types, Intro to Small Multiples
* [Week10](Week10): Small Multiples, Intro to Maps
* [Week11](Week11): Maps: D3, Leaflet, CartoDB...
* [Week12](Week12): Storytelling Techniques: Scrollytelling, Steppers
* [Week13](Week13): Animation: Lines, Play/Pause...
* [Week14](Week14):  Reusable charts, Other Layouts, Project Tips/Grading
* [Week15](Week15): Helpful Tips: How to File a Bug Report, Debugging

All the made-for-class example files are [here](examples.html). Many other examples are linked in each week's folder.

### 2. Programming Techniques and Tools We'll Cover

* Good practices with D3.js for data vis
* Javascript and useful libraries like jQuery, lodash
* Web Charting libs like Highcharts, D3, libs on top of D3 like Dimple.js
* GitHub use
* Debugging how-to's

### 3. Evaluation

Grading based on weekly homeworks (60%) and a final project (40%) that uses many of the techniques in a storytelling project using data that interests you.  This is a project course - you will be making things more than you will be reading or writing, but there will be a bit of that, too.

Primary emphasis is on end user experience and data honesty; secondary consideration will be good coding practices.

**Homework Due Dates**: Due by 5pm on Monday before class day, unless I decide otherwise... You will be submitting links by email (arnicas@gmail.com).

## Data Sources To Use

### UNICEF & Child Mortality (Fall Semester Client, optional for Spring)

* [The client brief](miscfiles/APromiseRenewed_Brief_March2015.pdf)
* The 2014 Key Findings Report on http://www.apromiserenewed.org/: [pdf](http://www.apromiserenewed.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/A-Promise-Renewed-2014-Key-Findings.pdf) (plus other publications that may be useful!)
* Their data sites: http://data.unicef.org/index.php, http://mics.unicef.org
* World Health Org (WHO): http://www.who.int/research/en/
* http://childmortality.org/ - UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME), of which UNICEF is a member (new data coming in September)

### Links to Datasets

* Jeremy Singer-Vine's excellent tinyletter archives for Data Is Plural (and maybe get on the list!): http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive, his [giant spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)
* [My delicious links to datasets](https://delicious.com/arnicas/datasets)

* Sets collected by Curran Kelleher: https://github.com/curran/data
* A big list of CSV datasets: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html


### Quantified Self

Use yourself as data! Learn about yourself! Fitbit's, sleep trackers, self-logging...Amazon shopping logs, email data, Facebook friends, etc!

* A long list of data sources, tools, etc. on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self)
* Nicolas Felton's Annual Reports: started analogue, then developed an IPhone app (http://feltron.com/apps.html) and got digital with Processing: e.g., http://feltron.com/far14.html
* Flowing Data links on "self-surveillance": http://flowingdata.com/category/self-surveillance/

You can't improve what you don't measure :)


## Background: D3 Books and Tutorial Materials

* **Interactive Data Visualization for the Web** ("IDVW"), Scott Murrayâ€™s book: http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book
Online version: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345.  [Code samples here](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book). *This is the book I'll assign most intro D3 readings from.*
* **D3 Tips and Tricks** book by Malcolm MacLean, and http://www.d3noob.org/
* **D3.js in Action** ("D3IA"), by Elijah Meeks.  If you want ebook, order via Manning: http://www.manning.com/.  This is a more advanced book than Scott's, and covers many D3 layouts we won't get to in class.  Recommended for going further.
* **Developing a D3 Edge** by By Chris Viau, Andrew Thornton, Ger Hobbelt, and Roland Dunn: http://bleedingedgepress.com/our-books/developing-a-d3-js-edge/ (intermediate (i.e., more advanced than the ones above; covers good coding patterns too.)
* Tutorials by **Mike Bostock**, primary author of D3: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials (and some others listed).
* **Learn JS Data** from Bocoup.com: http://learnjsdata.com/index.html
* **Blocksplorer**: search for code examples in D3 blocks! http://bl.ocksplorer.org/
* Great overall tips: https://northlandia.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/ten-best-practices-for-coding-with-d3/
* **D3 examples of Chart Types**: http://christopheviau.com/d3list/gallery.html
* **D3 Newbie FAQ**: I am working on this, and will be editing it as we encounter new ones :). https://github.com/arnicas/d3-faq
* Videos on D3:
    * Knight Center D3 Course video playlists: I'll recommend some of Scott Murray's videos as backup or weekend viewing. (They don't seem to be well-indexed on YouTube, but start [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightCenterMOOC/playlists).  The code examples are [here](https://github.com/alignedleft/data-vis-d3).
    * These intro videos seem good too: https://www.youtube.com/user/d3Vienno/videos


## JS Refreshers

* These books on HTML/CSS and JS/JQuery are good: http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440438330&sr=8-1&keywords=jon+duckett
* A short recap: http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/
* A super simple intro with gif demos is JS For Cats: http://jsforcats.com/
* Useful for your code style: **[Airbnb JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5)**
